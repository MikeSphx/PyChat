Program Description:

    This set of Python scripts use the Python Socket API in order to create a simple chat
application protocol using UDP connections.

    On the client script, a UDP socket connection is made and then the program splits into
two threads. One thread is for listening for incoming messages from the server/other clients.
The other thread is for accepting user input and sending commands out.

    On the server script, a UDP socket connection is also made bound to the port specified.
Everytime a new client signs-in, a packet is sent to all clients informing them of all of the
clients connected to the server, including the clients' IP and PORT information. This is
important for the client because the client will use this information to know where to send
messages to.

Requirements to run the program:

    Python version: 2.7.x (Developed on the CCIS machines with Python version 2.7.5)
    Python libraries imported: sys, os, argparse, socket, json, thread

How to Run the Program:

    1. cd into the project directory
    2. Run the server script (python server.py -sp [PORT])
    3. Repeatable step: Run the client script (python client.py -u [USER] -sip [SERVER-IP] -sp [PORT])
        Note: Make sure the [PORT] chosen are the same for the client and server script
    4. Use any of the following commands in your client terminals:
        - list
            - This command lists all signed-in users on the server
        - send USERNAME MESSAGE
            - This command sends a message to a specified user on the server
    5. Once you are finished, Ctrl+C on each terminal to terminate the scripts
